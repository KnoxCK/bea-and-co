					<p>We have been using Bea & Co since July 2014 and can not speak highly enough of the wonderful service provided.  Our son is an actor and so often needs to be moved around places in London. We never have a moments worry about him being safely delivered to the right place at the correct time. More than providing a very safe and highly efficient  service, every single one of the Bea & Co team have been fantastic with our son, to the point where he actively looks forward to them visiting and never feels like he is being babysat. We would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending Bea & Co wholeheartedly.</p>

					<p>I was thrilled with the service Amy and her team provided for us. We recently required a sitter last minute to cover a cast memberâ€™s childcare problem. Child and sitter got on wonderfully (despite never having met) and we could not have been better served. Will recommend to everyone.  10/10 service. Will use every time from now on.</p>

					<p>Bea & Co. were recommended to us by a friend, to whom we are incredibly grateful. We both work in Theatre and in our line of work we often have irregular schedules with things changing at the last minute. Amy and her team have always been so flexible, helpful and understanding. They are all reliable, friendly and trustworthy and most importantly brilliant with our wee one who always has a smashing time with them. We are so delighted to have found them and would not hesitate in recommending their service to anyone looking for child care.</p>

					<h5>Amy & Ewan</h5>
					<p>Part of the family since September 2014</p>
					<hr>
					<p>My year and a half year old fell in love with Amy from the moment she met her, despite always having been reluctant to be looked after by anyone else. My daughter is now 5-and-a-half and my boy nearly 4, and they are completely wild with excitement when they know that Amy is coming! We go away happy in the knowledge that the children are not just in safe hands but are also very happy and come back to find cakes have been baked, decorations and cards made, new games invented, new songs and dances learnt, and a lot of fun has been had. Amy is 100% reliable, firm but kind, thoughtful and trustworthy. We are so happy with them and I cannot recommend them more highly.</p>

					<hr>
					<p>Bea & Co. was recommended to me by a performer friend and I have not looked back. They have been faultless in all communications, reassuring where needed and totally understand my needs. The girls who take care of our children (8 & 10) are young, fun, efficient and full of beans. They are so amazing with the children and are on hand to help me with literally anything, from picking up milk to helping with school projects or swimming. I would highly recommend this company and feel that with this impressive young woman Amy Beadel at the helm, Bea & Co are the new way forward in childcare.</p>
